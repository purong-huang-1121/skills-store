# Hyperliquid Perpetual & Spot Trading CLI

11 commands for perpetual futures and spot trading on Hyperliquid: market data, orderbook, funding rates, and order management.

## Pre-flight Checks

Every time before running any `plugin-store` command, always follow these steps in order. Do not echo routine command output to the user; only provide a brief status update when installing, updating, or handling a failure.

1. **Confirm installed**: Run `which plugin-store`. If not found, install it:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   If the install script fails, ask the user to install manually following the instructions at: https://github.com/okx/plugin-store

2. **Check for updates**: Read `~/.plugin-store/last_check` and compare it with the current timestamp:
   ```bash
   cached_ts=$(cat ~/.plugin-store/last_check 2>/dev/null || true)
   now=$(date +%s)
   ```
   - If `cached_ts` is non-empty and `(now - cached_ts) < 43200` (12 hours), skip the update and proceed.
   - Otherwise (file missing or older than 12 hours), run the installer to check for updates:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
     ```
3. If any `plugin-store` command fails with an unexpected error during this session, try reinstalling before giving up.

## Skill Routing

- For token search / analytics -> use `okx-dex-token`
- For DEX swap -> use `okx-dex-swap`
- For token prices / charts -> use `okx-dex-market`
- For wallet balances -> use `okx-wallet-portfolio`
- For transaction broadcasting -> use `okx-onchain-gateway`
- For prediction markets -> use `okx-dapp-polymarket`
- For DeFi lending -> use `okx-dapp-aave`

## Authentication

**Data commands (markets, spot-markets, price, orderbook, funding):** No authentication needed. Work immediately.

**Trading commands (buy, sell, cancel, positions, balances, orders):** Require an EVM wallet private key:

```bash
# Add to .env file
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

The private key is used to sign Hyperliquid L1 actions via EIP-712 typed data signatures.

## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Workflow A: Research and Trade (most common)

> User: "What's the funding rate on BTC? I want to open a long."

```
1. hyperliquid funding BTC                          -> show current and historical funding rates
       | user decides to go long
2. hyperliquid price BTC                            -> check current mid price
3. hyperliquid orderbook BTC                        -> check spread and liquidity
       | user confirms trade
4. Check EVM_PRIVATE_KEY is set
       | not set -> prompt user to add to .env
       | set -> continue
5. hyperliquid buy --symbol BTC --size 0.01 --price 65000 --leverage 10
       |
6. "Opened long 0.01 BTC at $65,000 with 10x leverage. Liquidation price: $58,500."
```

**Data handoff:**
- `symbol` from markets data -> `--symbol` for trading commands
- Mid price from `price` -> reference for `--price` in buy/sell
- Funding rate from `funding` -> helps user decide long vs short

### Workflow B: Position Management

```
1. hyperliquid positions                             -> show all open perp positions
2. hyperliquid orders --symbol BTC                   -> check pending orders on BTC
3. hyperliquid cancel --symbol BTC --order-id 123456 -> cancel a stale order
4. hyperliquid sell --symbol BTC --size 0.01 --price 66000  -> close long by selling
```

### Workflow C: Spot Trading

```
1. hyperliquid spot-markets                          -> browse available spot pairs
2. hyperliquid price PURR                            -> check price of a spot token
3. hyperliquid orderbook PURR                        -> check liquidity
4. hyperliquid buy --symbol PURR --size 100 --price 0.50  -> buy spot tokens
```

### Workflow D: With OKX Skills

```
1. okx-wallet-portfolio balance --chain arbitrum     -> check USDC balance on Arbitrum
2. hyperliquid markets                               -> browse perp markets
3. hyperliquid buy --symbol ETH --size 1 --price 3500 --leverage 5  -> open position
4. hyperliquid positions                             -> verify position opened
```

## Operation Flow

### Step 1: Identify Intent

- Browse perpetual markets -> `markets`
- Browse spot markets -> `spot-markets`
- Check current price -> `price`
- Check orderbook depth -> `orderbook`
- Check funding rates -> `funding`
- Open a long / buy spot -> `buy`
- Open a short / sell spot -> `sell`
- Cancel an order -> `cancel`
- View open positions -> `positions`
- Check balances -> `balances`
- View open orders -> `orders`

### Step 2: Collect Parameters

- Missing symbol for price/orderbook/funding -> use `markets` or `spot-markets` first, then pick from the list
- Missing size for buy/sell -> ask user how much they want to trade
- Missing price for buy/sell -> use `price` to get current mid price, then ask user for limit price
- Missing leverage for buy -> default is current account leverage; ask if user wants to change it
- Missing order-id for cancel -> use `orders` to list open orders, then pick the one to cancel
- Missing private key (for trading) -> prompt to set `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`

### Step 3: Execute

- **Data phase**: show market info, prices, funding rates, orderbook depth to help user make an informed decision
- **Confirmation phase**: before any buy/sell, display symbol, size, price, leverage, estimated liquidation price, and ask for confirmation
- **Execution phase**: submit order, show result with order status

### Step 4: Suggest Next Steps

| Just completed | Suggest |
|---|---|
| `markets` | 1. Check price -> `price` 2. Check funding -> `funding` 3. View orderbook -> `orderbook` |
| `spot-markets` | 1. Check spot price -> `price` 2. Buy spot tokens -> `buy` |
| `price` | 1. View orderbook -> `orderbook` 2. Place order -> `buy` or `sell` |
| `orderbook` | 1. Place order -> `buy` or `sell` |
| `funding` | 1. Open position -> `buy` or `sell` 2. Check positions -> `positions` |
| `buy` | 1. Check positions -> `positions` 2. View open orders -> `orders` |
| `sell` | 1. Check positions -> `positions` 2. View open orders -> `orders` |
| `cancel` | 1. View remaining orders -> `orders` 2. Place new order -> `buy` or `sell` |
| `positions` | 1. Close position -> `sell` or `buy` 2. Check balances -> `balances` |
| `balances` | 1. Open position -> `buy` 2. Check positions -> `positions` |
| `orders` | 1. Cancel order -> `cancel` 2. Check positions -> `positions` |

Present conversationally -- never expose skill names or endpoint paths to the user.

## Key Concepts

- **Perpetual Futures**: Contracts with no expiry date that track an underlying index price. Positions can be held indefinitely, with funding payments keeping the contract price aligned with the index.
- **Funding Rate**: Hourly payment exchanged between longs and shorts to keep the perpetual price close to the index. Positive rate means longs pay shorts; negative means shorts pay longs. Capped at 4% per hour.
- **Leverage**: Multiplier on position exposure relative to margin posted. BTC supports up to 50x, other assets vary. Higher leverage means smaller margin requirement but closer liquidation price.
- **Cross Margin vs Isolated Margin**: Hyperliquid uses cross margin by default -- all positions share the same margin pool. This means PnL from one position can offset losses in another, but also means a large loss can affect all positions.
- **Liquidation Price**: The mark price at which a position is force-closed because margin is insufficient. Calculate by considering entry price, leverage, and maintenance margin. Always monitor this value.
- **szDecimals**: Each asset has a specific size precision. For example, BTC has szDecimals=5, meaning the smallest order increment is 0.00001 BTC. Orders with incorrect precision are rejected.
- **Spot Asset Index**: Spot assets on Hyperliquid are identified by index = 10000 + universe_index. For example, if PURR is at universe index 0, its spot index is 10000.
- **Mark Price vs Mid Price**: Mark price is the fair price used for PnL and liquidation calculations (based on index price and funding). Mid price is simply (best bid + best ask) / 2 from the orderbook.
- **USDC Margin**: All perpetual positions are margined in USDC. You need USDC on Hyperliquid L1 to trade perps.

## Edge Cases

- **Insufficient margin**: If the user tries to open a position larger than their available balance supports at the given leverage, the order will be rejected. Check balances first via `balances`.
- **Invalid size precision**: Orders must respect the `szDecimals` for each asset. Use `markets` to check the required precision before placing orders. Orders with too many decimal places are rejected.
- **Leverage limits**: Maximum leverage varies by asset (e.g. 50x for BTC, 20x for smaller assets). Attempting to exceed the limit will fail. Check `maxLeverage` from `markets`.
- **Self-trade prevention**: Hyperliquid prevents orders that would trade against yourself. If you have a resting sell and place a crossing buy, the system may cancel one.
- **Private key not set**: For trading commands, show clear error: "Set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file"
- **Symbol not found**: If a symbol is not recognized, suggest using `markets` or `spot-markets` to see available assets.
- **Rate limiting**: Hyperliquid has rate limits on API calls. Use retry with backoff.
- **Minimum order size**: Each asset has a minimum order size. Very small orders below this threshold will be rejected.
- **Funding accrual**: Funding is settled continuously. When holding positions across funding intervals, PnL will include accumulated funding payments.
- **Spot vs perp symbols**: Some symbols exist in both perp and spot markets. The CLI resolves this based on context -- `buy`/`sell` default to perp unless the symbol is spot-only.

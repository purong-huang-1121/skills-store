# Aave V3 Lending Protocol CLI

7 commands for lending market data, reserve details, account positions, supply/withdraw, and borrow/repay operations.

## Pre-flight Checks

Every time before running any `plugin-store` command, always follow these steps in order. Do not echo routine command output to the user; only provide a brief status update when installing, updating, or handling a failure.

1. **Confirm installed**: Run `which plugin-store`. If not found, install it:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   If the install script fails, ask the user to install manually following the instructions at: https://github.com/okx/plugin-store

2. **Check for updates**: Read `~/.plugin-store/last_check` and compare it with the current timestamp:
   ```bash
   cached_ts=$(cat ~/.plugin-store/last_check 2>/dev/null || true)
   now=$(date +%s)
   ```
   - If `cached_ts` is non-empty and `(now - cached_ts) < 43200` (12 hours), skip the update and proceed.
   - Otherwise (file missing or older than 12 hours), run the installer to check for updates:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
     ```
3. If any `plugin-store` command fails with an unexpected error during this session, try reinstalling before giving up.

## Skill Routing

- For token search / analytics → use `okx-dex-token`
- For DEX swap → use `okx-dex-swap`
- For token prices / charts → use `okx-dex-market`
- For wallet balances → use `okx-wallet-portfolio`
- For transaction broadcasting → use `okx-onchain-gateway`
- For prediction markets → use `okx-dapp-polymarket`

## Authentication

**Data commands (markets, reserve, account):** No authentication needed. Work immediately.

**Transaction commands (supply, withdraw, borrow, repay):** Require an EVM wallet private key:

```bash
# Add to .env file
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

The private key is used to sign supply, withdraw, borrow, and repay transactions on-chain.

## Quickstart

### Browse and Research

```bash
# List all Aave V3 markets on Ethereum
plugin-store aave markets --chain ethereum

# Get reserve details for USDC
plugin-store aave reserve USDC --chain ethereum

# Check account positions
plugin-store aave account 0xYourAddress --chain ethereum
```

### Supply and Withdraw

```bash
# Supply 100 USDC to Aave on Ethereum
plugin-store aave supply --token USDC --amount 100 --chain ethereum

# Withdraw 50 USDC from Aave
plugin-store aave withdraw --token USDC --amount 50 --chain ethereum

# Withdraw all USDC (full balance)
plugin-store aave withdraw --token USDC --amount max --chain ethereum
```

### Borrow and Repay

```bash
# Borrow 500 USDC against your collateral (variable rate)
plugin-store aave borrow --token USDC --amount 500 --chain ethereum

# Repay 200 USDC of your debt
plugin-store aave repay --token USDC --amount 200 --chain ethereum

# Repay all outstanding USDC debt
plugin-store aave repay --token USDC --amount max --chain ethereum
```

## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Workflow A: Research and Supply (most common)

> User: "What are the best lending rates on Aave right now?"

```
1. aave markets --chain ethereum                  → show all reserves with APYs
       ↓ user picks an asset
2. aave reserve USDC --chain ethereum              → show detailed reserve info
       ↓ user wants to supply
3. Check EVM_PRIVATE_KEY is set
       ↓ not set → prompt user to add to .env
       ↓ set → continue
4. aave supply --token USDC --amount 100 --chain ethereum
       ↓
5. "Supplied 100 USDC to Aave V3. You will receive aUSDC as a receipt token."
```

**Data handoff:**
- `symbol` from markets data → `<symbol>` for reserve/supply/withdraw commands
- `underlyingAsset` address is resolved automatically from the symbol

### Workflow B: Portfolio Review and Withdrawal

```
1. aave account 0xYourAddress --chain ethereum     → show positions, health factor
2. aave reserve WETH --chain ethereum              → check current rates on a position
3. aave withdraw --token WETH --amount max --chain ethereum  → withdraw full balance
```

### Workflow C: Multi-Chain Comparison

```
1. aave markets --chain ethereum                   → Ethereum rates
2. aave markets --chain polygon                    → Polygon rates
3. aave markets --chain arbitrum                   → Arbitrum rates
4. aave supply --token USDC --amount 100 --chain arbitrum  → supply on best chain
```

### Workflow D: With OKX Skills

```
1. okx-wallet-portfolio balance --chain ethereum   → check token balances
2. aave markets --chain ethereum                   → check lending rates
3. aave supply --token USDC --amount 100 --chain ethereum  → supply to Aave
```

## Operation Flow

### Step 1: Identify Intent

- Browse markets/rates → `markets`
- Check specific asset details → `reserve`
- Check account status → `account`
- Deposit/lend assets → `supply`
- Withdraw assets → `withdraw`
- Borrow against collateral → `borrow`
- Repay debt → `repay`

### Step 2: Collect Parameters

- Missing chain → ask user which chain (ethereum, polygon, or arbitrum)
- Missing symbol for reserve → use `markets` first, then pick from the list
- Missing address for account → ask user for their wallet address
- Missing amount for supply/withdraw/borrow/repay → ask user how much
- Missing private key (for supply/withdraw/borrow/repay) → prompt to set `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`

### Step 3: Execute

- **Data phase**: show market info, rates, positions, let user make informed decision
- **Confirmation phase**: before any supply/withdraw, display token, amount, chain, estimated APY, and ask for confirmation
- **Execution phase**: submit transaction, show result with tx hash

### Step 4: Suggest Next Steps

| Just completed | Suggest |
|---|---|
| `markets` | 1. Check specific reserve details → `reserve` 2. View account positions → `account` |
| `reserve` | 1. Supply assets → `supply` 2. Compare with other chains → `markets` on another chain |
| `account` | 1. Withdraw assets → `withdraw` 2. Supply more → `supply` |
| `supply` | 1. Check updated position → `account` 2. View reserve APY → `reserve` |
| `withdraw` | 1. Check updated position → `account` 2. View wallet balance → `okx-wallet-portfolio` |
| `borrow` | 1. Check health factor → `account` 2. Monitor borrow rate → `reserve` |
| `repay` | 1. Check updated debt → `account` 2. View wallet balance → `okx-wallet-portfolio` |

Present conversationally — never expose skill names or endpoint paths to the user.

## Key Concepts

- **Supply APY**: Annual percentage yield earned by supplying assets. Rates are variable and change based on utilization.
- **Health Factor**: Ratio indicating position safety. Above 1.0 is safe; below 1.0 means the position can be liquidated. Keep it well above 1.0 (recommended > 1.5).
- **aTokens**: Receipt tokens received when supplying (e.g. supply USDC, receive aUSDC). aTokens accrue interest automatically — their balance grows over time.
- **RAY**: Aave uses 27-decimal fixed-point numbers (1 RAY = 10^27) for rate calculations internally. The CLI converts these to human-readable percentages.
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value)**: Maximum percentage of collateral value that can be borrowed. E.g. 80% LTV means you can borrow up to 80% of your collateral value.
- **Liquidation Threshold**: The LTV level at which a position becomes eligible for liquidation. Always higher than the max LTV.
- **Utilization Rate**: Ratio of total borrowed to total supplied. Higher utilization = higher rates for both suppliers and borrowers.

## Edge Cases

- **Insufficient balance**: If the user tries to supply more than their wallet balance, the transaction will fail. Check balance first via `okx-wallet-portfolio`.
- **Health factor risk**: When withdrawing collateral or borrowing, warn if the resulting health factor would drop below 1.5. Withdrawing/borrowing too much can trigger liquidation.
- **Borrow capacity**: User must have sufficient collateral before borrowing. Check available borrows via `account` command.
- **Max repay**: Use `--amount max` to repay the full outstanding debt including accrued interest.
- **Max withdrawal**: Use `--amount max` to withdraw the full supplied balance including accrued interest. This uses `type(uint256).max` internally.
- **Token approval**: First-time supply of a token requires an ERC-20 approval transaction. The CLI handles this automatically but it will use additional gas.
- **Private key not set**: For supply/withdraw commands, show clear error: "Set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file"
- **Unsupported chain**: Only ethereum, polygon, and arbitrum are supported. Other chains will return an error.
- **Asset not listed**: If a token symbol is not recognized as an Aave V3 reserve, suggest using `markets` to see available assets.
- **Rate limiting**: OKX API has rate limits. Use retry with backoff.

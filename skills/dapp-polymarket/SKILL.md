Covers market search, price queries, orderbook data, price history, and trading (buy/sell outcome shares). Do NOT use for general DEX swaps or token trading — use okx-dex-swap instead."

# Polymarket Prediction Markets CLI

12 commands for prediction market search, pricing, and trading.

## Pre-flight Checks

Every time before running any `plugin-store` command, always follow these steps in order. Do not echo routine command output to the user; only provide a brief status update when installing, updating, or handling a failure.

1. **Confirm installed**: Run `which plugin-store`. If not found, install it:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   If the install script fails, ask the user to install manually following the instructions at: https://github.com/okx/plugin-store

2. **Check for updates**: Read `~/.plugin-store/last_check` and compare it with the current timestamp:
   ```bash
   cached_ts=$(cat ~/.plugin-store/last_check 2>/dev/null || true)
   now=$(date +%s)
   ```
   - If `cached_ts` is non-empty and `(now - cached_ts) < 43200` (12 hours), skip the update and proceed.
   - Otherwise (file missing or older than 12 hours), run the installer to check for updates:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purong-huang-1121/skills-store/main/install.sh | sh
     ```
3. If any `plugin-store` command fails with an unexpected error during this session, try reinstalling before giving up.

## Skill Routing

- For token search / analytics → use `okx-dex-token`
- For DEX swap → use `okx-dex-swap`
- For token prices / charts → use `okx-dex-market`
- For wallet balances → use `okx-wallet-portfolio`
- For transaction broadcasting → use `okx-onchain-gateway`

## Authentication

**Data commands (search, markets, event, price, book, history):** No authentication needed. Work immediately.

**Trading commands (buy, sell, cancel, orders, positions, balance):** Require a Polygon wallet private key:

```bash
# Add to .env file
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

API credentials are automatically derived from the private key on first use and cached at `~/.plugin-store/polymarket_creds.json`.

## Quickstart

### Browse and Research

```bash
# Search for markets about bitcoin
plugin-store polymarket search "bitcoin"

# List hottest markets by volume
plugin-store polymarket markets --sort volume --limit 10

# Get event details
plugin-store polymarket event <event_id>

# Check Yes/No price
plugin-store polymarket price <token_id>

# View orderbook
plugin-store polymarket book <token_id>

# Price history (daily)
plugin-store polymarket history <token_id> --interval 1d
```

### Trade

```bash
# Buy 100 USDC of Yes at 0.65
plugin-store polymarket buy --token <token_id> --amount 100 --price 0.65

# Sell 50 shares at 0.70
plugin-store polymarket sell --token <token_id> --amount 50 --price 0.70

# Check open orders
plugin-store polymarket orders

# Cancel an order
plugin-store polymarket cancel <order_id>

# View positions and balance
plugin-store polymarket positions
plugin-store polymarket balance
```

## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Workflow A: Search and Buy (most common)

> User: "What are the hottest prediction markets right now?"

```
1. polymarket markets --sort volume --limit 5     → show top markets
       ↓ user picks one
2. polymarket price <token_id>                     → show Yes/No prices
       ↓ user wants to buy
3. Check EVM_PRIVATE_KEY is set
       ↓ not set → prompt user to add to .env
       ↓ set → continue
4. polymarket buy --token <token_id> --amount 100 --price 0.65
       ↓
5. "Order placed! 100 USDC @ 0.65 for ~153 Yes shares."
```

**Data handoff:**
- `clobTokenIds` from market data → `<token_id>` for price/buy/sell commands
- Markets typically have 2 token IDs: index 0 = Yes, index 1 = No

### Workflow B: Portfolio Review

```
1. polymarket positions                            → show all holdings with PnL
2. polymarket price <token_id>                     → check current price of a position
3. polymarket sell --token <token_id> --amount 50 --price 0.70  → take profit
```

### Workflow C: Market Research

```
1. polymarket search "AI"                          → find AI-related markets
2. polymarket event <event_id>                     → see all markets in the event
3. polymarket book <token_id>                      → check liquidity depth
4. polymarket history <token_id> --interval 1d     → price trend
```

### Workflow D: With OKX Skills

```
1. okx-wallet-portfolio balance --chain polygon    → check USDC on Polygon
2. polymarket search "ethereum"                    → find ETH prediction markets
3. polymarket buy ...                              → place bet
```

## Operation Flow

### Step 1: Identify Intent

- Browse markets → `search` or `markets`
- Check price/odds → `price`
- Analyze depth → `book`
- Check trend → `history`
- Buy/sell → `buy` / `sell`
- Manage orders → `orders` / `cancel`
- Check portfolio → `positions` / `balance`

### Step 2: Collect Parameters

- Missing search query → ask user what topic they're interested in
- Missing token_id → use `search` or `markets` first, then extract `clobTokenIds` from the result
- Missing price for buy/sell → show current price via `price` command, suggest using midpoint
- Missing amount → ask user how much USDC they want to spend
- Missing private key (for trading) → prompt to set `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`

### Step 3: Execute

- **Data phase**: show market info, prices, let user make informed decision
- **Confirmation phase**: before any buy/sell, display price, amount, expected shares, and ask for confirmation
- **Execution phase**: place order, show result

### Step 4: Suggest Next Steps

| Just completed | Suggest |
|---|---|
| `search` or `markets` | 1. Check price of a specific market → `price` 2. View orderbook → `book` |
| `price` | 1. Buy/sell shares 2. View price history → `history` |
| `buy` or `sell` | 1. Check order status → `orders` 2. View updated positions → `positions` |
| `positions` | 1. Check current price of a holding → `price` 2. Sell a position → `sell` |

## Key Concepts

- **Prices are probabilities**: Price 0.65 means 65% implied probability. Buying Yes at 0.65 means you pay $0.65 per share and receive $1.00 if Yes wins.
- **Two token IDs per market**: `clobTokenIds[0]` = Yes outcome, `clobTokenIds[1]` = No outcome.
- **USDC on Polygon**: All trading uses USDC on Polygon network.
- **Order book model**: Polymarket uses a CLOB (central limit order book), not AMM. Orders may not fill immediately.

## Edge Cases

- **Market closed/resolved**: Check `active` and `closed` fields. Don't allow trading on closed markets.
- **Low liquidity**: If `book` shows thin orders, warn user about slippage.
- **Price out of range**: Price must be strictly between 0 and 1. Reject 0 or 1.
- **Private key not set**: For trading commands, show clear error: "Set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file"
- **Rate limiting**: Polymarket API has rate limits. Use retry with backoff.
